Recommended: Load notebooks into Constellate's environment at https://constellate.org/notebook/own/. Requires Northeastern affiliation and JSTOR account.

Alternatively, my personal Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jasf-/tdm-nbs/master) can be used to launch notebooks. Note that not all functions will work outside the Constellate environment.
