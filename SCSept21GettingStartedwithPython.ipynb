We'll cover a few Python basics here, giving you the tools to understand some core concepts and run several pre-constructed analyses. If you'd like to learn more, the Constellate team has published [lessons](https://constellate.org/docs/) running from beginner to intermediate, and there are many additional resources online for learning Python, such as [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/)."

This particular **[expression](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#expression)** is a combination of two **values** (1 and 3) and an **operator** (`+`). In Python, **expressions** are combinations of values, operators, functions, and variables (more on these last two soon!). \n",

    "An [integer](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#integer), what we sometimes call a \"whole number,\" is a number without a decimal point that can be positive or negative. When a value uses a decimal, it is called a [float](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#float) or floating-point number. Two numbers that are mathematically equivalent could be in two different data types. For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an integer while the latter is a float. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a [string](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#string). A string can be written with single or double quotes. A string can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers. So 5 is an integer and 5.0 is a float, but '5' and '5.0' are strings. A string can also be blank, such as ''. \n",

    "\n",
    "The distinction between each of these data types may seem unimportant, but Python treats each one differently. For example, we can ask Python whether an integer is equal to a float, but we cannot ask whether a string is equal to an integer or a float.\n",
